<p>Thank you for speaking with us in your first interview, as mentioned in your interview we have created a tech test that will allow us to review your coding skills.</p>
<p>For this test, we are asking that you recreate the design given within the 'test-content' folder. Within this folder you will find a design for desktop & mobile devices and also a text file with all of the text needed for this build.</p>
<p>All images for this build have been provided and are in the 'images' folder. Use all images provided and accurately to the given designs.</p>
<p>All CSS must be within the styles.css file.</p>

## Task List:
<ol>
    <li>Please clone this repo and once you have completed the tasks, create a pull request. We will be notified with a pull request where we will review your build and discuss our next steps. If you are unsure about cloning the repo and creating a pull request, we are happy for you to download the files and emailing your final build to Zac Rimmer - zrimmer@regatta.com</li>
    <li>From the desktop design given, build the page as accurately as possible using the images and text provided.</li>
    <li>Build the page to be fully responsive to mobile and follow the mobile design given.</li>
</ol>

## Bonus Task:
<ol>
    <li>Instead of writing the press contact details in through the HTML, using vuejs write a v-for that prints out the name and contact details for the press section. The script for this needs to be setup within the index.html file.</li>
</ol>
